# WPF Tutorial

This project was created as a result of my learning basic Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) operations in the C# programming language. 
Having previously worked with WinForms, I wanted to explore how to build applications using WPF from scratch.

## Description

The goal of this project is to provide a practical guide for beginners to get started with WPF development. 
It covers fundamental concepts and functionalities of WPF, including but not limited to:

- Creating WPF applications
- Working with XAML for designing user interfaces
- Handling user input events
- Data binding
- Styling and theming
- Working with controls and layouts

## This project is still a work in progress, and I am continuing to explore and learn more about WPF functionalities and best practices.
